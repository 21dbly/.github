# Caddy

![Caddy](caddyLogo.png)

Caddy is a web server that listens for incoming HTTP requests. Caddy then either serves up the requested static files or routes the request to another web server. This ability to route requests is called a `gateway`, or `reverse proxy`, and allows you to expose multiple web services (i.e. your project services) as a single external web service (i.e. Caddy).

For this course, we use Caddy for the following reasons.

- Caddy handles all of the creation and rotation of web certificates. This allows us to easily support HTTPS.
- Caddy serves up all of your static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. All early project work will be hosted as static files.
- Caddy acts as a gateway for requests for your project subdomains to web services that are hosting your Simon and Start up projects using node.js as an internal web server.

Caddy is preinstalled and configured on your server and so you do not need to do anything specifically with it other than configure your root domain name.

## Important Caddy files

As part of the installation of Caddy we created two links in the Ubuntu user's home directory that point to the key Caddy configuration files. There links were created in the home directory so that you do not have to hunt around your server looking for these files.

- **Configuration file**: `~/Caddyfile`

  Contains the definitions for routing HTTP requests that Caddy receives. This is used to determine the location where static HTML files are loaded from, and also to proxy requests into the services you will create later. Except for when you configure the domain name of your server, you should never have to modify this file manually. However, it is good to know how it works incase things go wrong. You can read about this in the [Caddy Server documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile).

- **HTML files**: `~/public_html`

  This is the directory of files that Caddy servers up when requests are made to the root or your web server. This is configured in the Caddyfile discussed above. If you actually look at the Caddyfile you will see that the static file server is mapped to `/usr/share/caddy`. That is the location that the file link in the Ubuntu user's home directory, `~/public_html`, is pointing to.

  ```
  :80 {
        root * /usr/share/caddy
        file_server
  }
  ```

  Therefore, according to this configuration, whenever Caddy receives an HTTP request for any domain name on port 80 it will use the path of the request to find a corresponding file in this directory. For example, a request for `http://yourdomainname/index.html` will look for a file named `index.html` in the `public_html` directory.

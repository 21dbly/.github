# Acknowledgements

The instruction makes extensive use of [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) and we highly encourage you to spend many hours getting lost in their exceptional content.

The demonstration application `Simon` is based on the game by Milton-Bradley. Simon is a registered trademark of Milton-Bradley. Our use of the name and the game is for non-profit educational use only. No part of the Simon code program should be used outside of that definition.

Much appreciation goes to [CodePen](codepen.io) for hosting the exercises and instruction examples.

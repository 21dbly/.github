## Commit often

You will be required to have at least 4 commits for each assignment that you submit in order to get full credit. Commonly this will be an initial commit contains empty project files, followed by commits at each functional milestone, and then final commit for the working project. Committing your code often is an important practice for you to develop. It protects your from losing your work, allows access from anywhere, makes it so you can quickly share changes, reduces conflicts with your peers, and enables you to efficiently explore different possibilities. This also helps proves the originality of your work.

Remember to make meaningful commit messages that describe the what and why of the changes made.

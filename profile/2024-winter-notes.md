| 1   | Intro   | Lots of energy to get them excited. Explain pedagogy, main deliverables. The demo at the end is key. Magic card works because it is flashy and quick.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2   | Git/Hub | Can't do the details of Git and GitHub in 50 minutes. I briefly explained the two things that Git allows you to do (versions/collaboration) and then drove the entire discussion from the standpoint of GitHub and using VS code. The students got this and it is closer to what they are going to actually do. Definitely do this next time. |
| 3   | Startup |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## JavaScript modules

ðŸ“– **Suggested reading**: [MDN JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)

JavaScript modules allow for the partitioning and sharing of code. Initially JavaScript had no support for modules. Node.js, a server side JavaScript execution application, introduced the concept of modules in order to support the importing of packages of JavaScript from third party providers.

JavaScript got full module support with ES6, and they have become the standard module representation as [browser support](https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import) for JavaScript modules is now almost universal.

In order to differentiate between the two implementations, Node.js modules are called CommonJS modules, and JavaScript modules are called ES modules.

Because modules create a file based scope for the code they represent, you must explicitly `export` the objects that you want to be visible outside the module. For example, here is a simple module that exports a function that displays an alert.

**alert.js**

```js
export function alertDisplay(msg) {
  alert(msg);
}
```

You can import the module's exported function into another module using the `import` keyword.

**main.js**

```js
import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';

alertDisplay('called from main.js');
```

When you use CommonJS modules the Node.js runtime treats all JavaScript as if it were modules and so it works seamlessly. When you use ES modules in the browser, via HTML script references, things get a little more complicated. The key thing to understand is that modules can only be called from other modules. You cannot import a module object into a globally scoped JavaScript file.

From your HTML, you can differentiate that you are using a ES module by including the type of `module` in the `script` element. You can then import and use other modules and even make a module's object visible in the global scope. In the example below, we expose the `alertDisplay` imported function by attaching it to the global JavaScript `window` object so that it can then be called from the button `onclick` handler.

**index.html**

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';
      window.btnClick = alertDisplay;
    </script>
    <button onclick="btnClick('called from index.html')">Press me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

Fortunately, when you use a web framework bundler, discussed in later instruction, to generate your web application distribution code, you don't have to worry about differentiating between global Javascript files and JavaScript ES modules. The bundler will inject all the necessary syntax to connect your HTML to your modules. Historically, this was done by removing the modules and placing all of the JavaScript in a namespaced global partition. Now that ES Modules are supported on most browsers, the bundler will expose the ES module directly.

Because of the complex history of modules they can be a confusing topic, but it is well worth the time to understand how they work as they are a core piece of a web programmer's toolkit.

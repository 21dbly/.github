# JavaScript rest and spread

## Rest

Sometimes you want a function to take an unknown number of parameters. For example, if you wanted to write a function that checks to see if some number in a list is equal to a given number. You could write this using an array.

```js
function hasNumber(test, numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

const a = [1, 2, 3];
hasNumber(2, a);
// RETURNS: true
```

However sometimes you don't have an array to work with. In this case you could create one on the fly.

```js
function hasTwo(a, b, c) {
  return hasNumber(2, [a, b, c]);
}
```

But JavaScript provides the `rest` syntax to make this easier. Think of it as a parameter that contains the `rest` of the parameters. To turn the last parameter to any function into a `rest` parameter you prefix it with three periods and then you can call it with any number of parameters and they are all automatically combined into an array.

```js
function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
// RETURNS: true
```

Note that you can only make the last parameter a `rest` parameter. Otherwise JavaScript would not know which parameters where combined into which array.

Technically speaking, `rest` allows JavaScript to provide what is called variadic functions.

## Spread

Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following.

```js
function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const name = 'Ryan Dahl';
const person = person(...name.split(' '));
console.log(person);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
```

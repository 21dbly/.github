# Data services

Web applications commonly need to store application and user data persistently. Data can represent many things, but it is usually a representation of complex interrelated objects. This includes this like a user profiles, organizational structure, game play information, usage history, billing information, peer relationships, library catalogs, and so forth.

Historically SQL databases have served as the general purpose data service solution, but starting around 2010 specialty data services that better support document, graph, JSON, time, sequence, and key-value pair data began to take significant roles in applications from major web application companies. These data services are often called NoSQL solutions because they do not use the general purpose relational database paradigms popularized by SQL databases. However, they all have very different underlying data structures, strengths, and weaknesses. That means that you should not simply split all of the possible data services into two narrowly defined box, SQL and NoSQL, when you are considering the right data service for your application.

Here is a list of some of the popular data services that are available.

| Service       | Specialty             |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| MySQL         | Relational queries    |
| Redis         | Memory cached objects |
| ElasticSearch | Ranked free text      |
| MongoDB       | JSON objects          |
| DynamoDB      | Key value pairs       |
| Neo4J         | Graph based data      |
| InfluxDB      | Time series data      |

## MongoDB

![MongoDB logo](webServicesMongoLogo.png)

For the projects in this course that require data services, we will use `MongoDB`. Mongo increases developer productivity by using JSON objects as its core data model. This makes it easy to have an application that uses JSON from the top to the bottom of the technology stack. A mongo database is made up of one or more collections that each contain JSON documents. You can think of a collection as a large array of JavaScript objects, each with a unique ID. The following is a sample of a collection of houses that are for rent.

```js
[
  {
    _id: '62300f5316f7f58839c811de',
    name: 'Lovely Loft',
    summary: 'A charming loft in Paris',
    beds: 1,
    last_review: {
      $date: '2022-03-15T04:06:17.766Z',
    },
    price: 3000,
  },
  {
    _id: '623010b97f1fed0a2df311f8',
    name: 'Infinite Views',
    summary: 'Modern home with infinite views from the infinity pool',
    property_type: 'House',
    beds: 5,
    price: 250,
  },
];
```

Unlike relational databases that require a rigid table definition where each column must be strictly typed and defined beforehand, Mongo has no strict schema requirements. Each document in the collection usually follows a similar schema, but each document may have specialized fields that are present, and common fields that are missing. This allows the schema of a collection to morph organically as the data model of the application evolves. To add a new field to a Mongo collection you just start insert the field into the documents as desired. If the field is not present, or has a different type, in some documents then the document simply doesn't match the query criteria when the field is referenced.

The query syntax for Mongo also follow a JavaScript inspired flavor. Consider the following queries on the houses for rent collection that was shown above.

```js
// find all houses
db.house.find();

// find houses with two or more bedrooms
db.house.find({ beds: { $gte: 2 } });

// find houses that are available with less than three beds
db.house.find({ status: 'available', beds: { $lt: 3 } });

// find houses with either less than three beds or less than $1000 a night
db.house.find({ $or: [(beds: { $lt: 3 }), (price: { $lt: 1000 })] });

// find houses with text 'modern' or 'beach' in the summary
db.house.find({ summary: /(modern|beach)/i });
```

### Using MongoDB in your application

ðŸ“– **Suggested reading**: [MongoDB tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/node-crud-tutorial/)

The first step to using Mongo in your application is to install the `mongodb` package using NPM.

```sh
âžœ npm install mongodb
```

With that done you then use the `MongoClient` object to make a client connection to the database server. This requires a username, password, and the hostname of the database server.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

const userName = 'holowaychuk';
const password = 'express';
const hostname = 'mongodb.com';

const uri = `mongodb+srv://${userName}:${password}@${hostname}`;

const client = new MongoClient(uri);
```

With the client connection you can then get a database object and from that a collection object. The collection object allows you to insert, and query for, documents. You do not have to do anything special to insert a JavaScript object as a Mongo document. You just call the `insertOne` function on the collection object and pass it the JavaScript object. When you insert a document, if the database or collection does not exists, Mongo will automatically create them for you. When the document is inserted into the collection it will automatically be assigned a unique ID.

```js
const collection = client.db('rental').collection('house');

const house = {
  name: 'Beachfront views',
  summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
  property_type: 'Condo',
  beds: 1,
};
await collection.insertOne(house);
```

To query for documents you use the `find` function on the collection object. Note that the find function is asynchronous and so we use the `await` keyword to wait for the promise to resolve before we write them out to the console.

```js
const cursor = collection.find();
const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
```

If you do not supply any parameters to the `find` function then it will return all documents in the collection. In this case we only get back the single document that we previously inserted. Notice that the automatically generated ID is returned with the document.

**Output**

```js
[
  {
    _id: new ObjectId('639a96398f8de594e198fc13'),
    name: 'Beachfront views',
    summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
    property_type: 'Condo',
    beds: 1,
  },
];
```

You can provide a query and options to the `find` function. In the example below we query for a `property_type` of Condo that has less than two bedrooms. We also specify the options to sort by the descending price, and limit our results to the first 10 documents.

```js
const query = { property_type: 'Condo', beds: { $lt: 2 } };

const options = {
  sort: { price: -1 },
  limit: 10,
};

const cursor = collection.find(query, options);
const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
```

The query matches our document and we get the same result as before.

There is a lot more functionality that MongoDB provides, but this is enough to get you started. If you are interested you can find lots of tutorials on their [website](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).

## Keeping your keys out of your code

You need to protect your credentials for connecting to your Mongo database. One common mistake is to check them into your code and then post it to a public GitHub repository. Instead you can read them from a location outside of your code when the application executes. One common way to do that is to read them from environment variables. The JavaScript `process.env` object provides access the environment.

```Javascript
const userName = process.env.MONGOUSER;
const password = process.env.MONGOPASSWORD;
const hostname = process.env.MONGOHOSTNAME;

if (!userName) {
  throw Error("Database not configured. Set environment variables");
}
```

This will require you to set these variables in your development and production environments before you can successfully execute. For your production environment, you can add your credentials for all users by modifying the `/etc/environment` file.

```
sudo vi /etc/environment
```

and adding the following environment exports.

```
export MONGOUSER=<yourmongodbusername>
export MONGOPASSWORD=<yourmongodbpassword>
export MONGOHOSTNAME=<yourmongodbhostname>
```

For your development environment add the same export commands to your shell's profile file. Depending on what console you are using the location for your shell profile will be different. For example, on a Mac you typically are using Zsh and you will add the export commands to the `.zprofile` file found in your user directory.

## Managed services

Historically each application development team would have developers that managed the data service. Those developers would acquisition hardware, install the database software, monitor the memory, cpu, and disk space, control the data schema, and handle migrations and upgrades. Much of this work has now moved to databases that are hosted and managed by an external provider. This relieves the development team from much of the day to day maintenance. This allows the team to focus more on the application and less on the infrastructure. With a managed data service you simply supply the data and the service grows, or shrinks, to support the desired capacity and performance criteria.

### MongoDB Atlas

All of the major cloud providers offer multiple data services. For this class we will use the data service provided by MongoDB called [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). No credit card or payment is required to setup and use Atlas, as long as you stick to the shared cluster environment.

[![Mongo sign up](webServicesMongoSignUp.jpg)](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

This [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daIH4o75KE8) will step you through the process of creating your account and setting up your database. Note that some of the Atlas website interface may be slightly different, but the basic concepts should all be there is some shape or form. The main steps you need to take are:

1. Create your account.
1. Create a database cluster.
1. Create your root database user credentials. Remember this for later use.
1. Set network access to your database to be available from anywhere.
1. Copy the connection string and use the information in your code.
1. Save the connection and credential information in your production and development environments as instructed above.

With that all done, you should be good to use Atlas from both your development and production environments. You can test that things are working correctly with the following example.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// Read the credentials from environment variables so that you do not accidentally check in your credentials
const userName = process.env.MONGOUSER;
const password = process.env.MONGOPASSWORD;
const hostname = process.env.MONGOHOSTNAME;

async function main() {
  // Connect to the database cluster
  const url = `mongodb+srv://${userName}:${password}@${hostname}`;
  const client = new MongoClient(url);
  const collection = client.db('rental').collection('house');

  // Insert a document
  const house = {
    name: 'Beachfront views',
    summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
    property_type: 'Condo',
    beds: 1,
  };
  await collection.insertOne(house);

  // Query the documents
  const query = { property_type: 'Condo', beds: { $lt: 2 } };
  const options = {
    sort: { score: -1 },
    limit: 10,
  };

  const cursor = collection.find(query, options);
  const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
  rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

1. Create a directory called `mongoTest`
1. Save the above content to a file named `main.js`
1. Run `npm init -y`
1. Run `npm install mongodb`
1. Run `node main.js`. This should output something like the following if everything is working correctly.
   ```js
   {
   _id: new ObjectId("639b51b74ef1e953b884ca5b"),
   name: 'Beachfront views',
   summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
   property_type: 'Condo',
   beds: 1
   }
   ```

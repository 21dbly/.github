## JavaScript

In 1995 Netscape (the popular browser maker at the time) decided to add the ability to script web pages. The initial implementation was lead by Brendan Eich and given the name JavaScript. This turn the previously static web into an interactive experience where a web page could dynamically change based upon a user's interaction.

In 1996 Netscape turned control of JavaScript over to the ECMA International in an attempt to standardize the definition of the language. At that point JavaScript officially became know as ECMAScript, although it is still commonly referred to as JavaScript.

The first decade of JavaScript was turbulent as each of the major browser vendors attempted to introduce new proprietary features in order to gain market share. Eventually in 2009 the major vendors agreed on the ECMAScript 5 standard and in 2015 ECMAScript 6 was released as the last major feature upgrade. Since then minor releases have taken the year of their release as their version number.

| year | version | features                  |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| 1997 | ES1     | initial release           |
| 1999 | ES3     | regex, exceptions, switch |
| 2009 | ES5     | json, array iteration     |
| 2015 | ES6     | let/const, default params |

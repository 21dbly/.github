# CSS Practice

Now that you know how to create CSS rules using selectors to apply declarations to HTML elements, it's time to experiment and see what you can come up with.

## â˜‘ Assignment

Create a CodePen that uses multiple CSS rules to style an HTML page

Make sure your CodePen includes:

1. Multiple rule sets
1. Selectors by ID, class, and element
1. Declarations for color, font, and positioning
1. Animation

When you are done upload the URL of your CodePen to the Canvas assignment.

Don't forget to update your GitHub startup repository notes.md with all of the things you learned and want to remember.

## Advanced examples

If you are looking for some examples of where CSS can take you, check out these CodePens:

- [Animated burger menu](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/bGKxVEv)
- [Home page](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/jOKvbrv)

Don't feel like you need to build anything this complex but try and take things a little beyond your current abilities.

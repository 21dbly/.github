# CodePen

This instruction makes extensive use of the coding sandbox website [CodePen](https://codepen.io). âš  You must create a free account on CodePen if you do not already have one. With your account you will experiment with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. These experiments are saved in a "pen" that each have a unique URL. In order to complete an assignment you will do the following steps:

1. Either create a new pen, or fork an existing example pen.
1. Conduct the experiment as defined by the assignment.
1. Save your assignment periodically so that you don't loose any work. In order to keep your CodePen account organized you should consider using pen collections for different technologies.
1. Submit the pen's URL in Canvas along with a description on some interesting thing that you learned.

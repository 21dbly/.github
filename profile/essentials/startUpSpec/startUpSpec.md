# Start up deliverable - specification

Your start up application demonstrates your mastery of the instruction presented by this course. Make sure you put significant effort into coming up with a simple yet interesting idea. Your application needs to demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, calling web services, providing web services, authentication, storing data persistently, using web sockets for peer to peer communication, and running as a progressive web application.

Create an elevator pitch for your application. Something that would excite an investment firm if you happen to catch a ride up the elevator with one of their representatives. Or maybe just sound cool to your friends if they are your target audience. This should be no more than a paragraph in length.

Then sketch out what the application looks like. You can use a tool like [NinjaMock.com](https://ninjamock.com/) to quickly produce a rough layout. Google docs, or plain old paper works fine too (just take pictures for your submission).

Here is an [example design](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md).

### Pair programming

If you have chosen to work with a partner using the pair programming development process, then the following steps should guide your combined development efforts. Remember that it is not required to use pair programming.

- You should share a repository for all your work on the startup application. Host the repo in one of the pair participant's GitHub account and then give the other pair participant rights to the repo.
- The design deliverable should be created together and submitted from your shared start up repository. Include a note specifying that you have a programming pair.
- Alternate commits to the start up repository. The driver should be doing the commits and their name should be associated with each commit. This means you will need to switch who is logged in when you do a commit.
- All work must be done **together** with one pair acting as the driver and the other acting as the navigator.
- Make sure you represent both pairs in the footer of your application.
- Each pair participant has a section in the start up application repository README.md where they record what they have learned.
- Each pair participant deploys the application to their individual production environments and submits the URL to their server when they submit each deliverable in Canvas.

## â˜‘ Assignment

Update the README.md file for your start up GitHub repository that you created in the earlier instruction to include your elevator pitch. Include the pitch paragraph, key features, and images.

Make sure you push your changes to the file so that it can be reviewed.

Submit the URL for your GitHub start up repository to the Canvas assignment.

## Grading Rubric

- 10% - Notes in your start up Git repository README.md that include your elevator pitch and key features
- 45% - A concise, compelling, elevator pitch
- 45% - One or more rough sketches of your application

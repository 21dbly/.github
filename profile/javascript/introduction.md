# JavaScript introduction

<img src="esLogo.png" width=100/>

JavaScript is a loosely typed language based upon concepts found in C, Java, and Scheme. It is also the most used programming language in the world. It runs on every web browser, is commonly used as a web server language, and for many serverless functions. In this instruction we will cover the basic parts of the language necessary to create a reasonable website. There are many features of the language that will not be discussed and you should take time to dig into the corners of the language as time allows. The more effectively you understand JavaScript the better web programmer you will be.

## JavaScript Versions

The following table describes the version history of JavaScript. This is important to know because browser compatibility is always an issue when developing a web application. When considering the use of a JavaScript feature you should consult websites like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs) or [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/) to see how well the feature is supported.

# Getting Started

Let's start with a basic example

Here is an example of a simple JavaScript program.

```javascript
const join = (...a) => {
  return a.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
};

console.log(join(1, 2));
console.log(join('hello', ' ', 'world', '!'));
```

The first decade of JavaScript was turbulent as each of the major browser vendors attempted to introduce new proprietary features in order to gain market share. Eventually in 2009 the major vendors agreed on the ECMAScript 5 standard and in 2015 ECMAScript 6 was released as the last major feature upgrade. Since then minor releases have taken the year of their release as their version number.

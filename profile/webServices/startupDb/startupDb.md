# Startup DB

Now that you have learned how to setup and use a database, it is time to add that functionality to your startup application. The main things you should focus on in this deliverable include connecting to the database, creating endpoints that accept and return data, storing and retrieving data from the database.

You must use the same startup GitHub repository that you created in the earlier instruction. Update the notes.md file with things that you learn as you work on your startup. As you make changes to your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript commit those changes and push them to GitHub. You will need at least four commits to get full credit, but in reality you should have many more than that.

Remember to use the browser's debugger window to debug your frontend HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can also debug your backend service JavaScript running on Node.js using the built in VS Code Node.js debugger.

Once you have developed your application to where you want it, you need to release it to your production environment. Use the `deployService.sh` script from the [Simon DB repository](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-db/blob/main/deployService.sh) and use `startup` for the service parameter (`-s`).

```sh
./deployService.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s startup
```

For example,

```sh
./deployService.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s startup
```

Doing this will make this deliverable of your startup available from `https://startup.yourdomainname`.

## â˜‘ Assignment

1. Add code for connecting to the database
1. Provide endpoints for adding, updating, and deleting your application data in the database
1. Persist data in MongoDB.
1. Display the user data in the frontend by manipulating the DOM.
1. Make sure your name is displayed in the application and that there is a link to your GitHub repository.
1. Debug your application using VS Code's Node debugger and the browser's dev tools, in your development environment to verify it is working correctly.
1. Periodically commit and push your code to GitHub.
1. Periodically update your startup repository's notes.md file to reflect what you have learned and want to remember.
1. Push your final version of your project to GitHub.
1. Deploy your startup application to your production environment (your server).
1. Make sure your application is available from your production environment.
1. Upload the URL to your startup application to the Canvas assignment.

## Grading Rubric

- (Required) Simon DB deployed to your production environment
- 20% - MongoDB Atlas database created
- 30% - Provides backend endpoints for manipulating application data
- 30% - Stores application data in MongoDB
- 10% - Multiple Git commits with meaningful comments.
- 10% - Notes in your startup Git repository README.md file documenting what you modified and added with this deliverable. Also add notes in your notes.md file describing what you have learned.

## Go celebrate

## JavaScript modules

ðŸ“– **Suggested reading**: [MDN JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)

JavaScript modules allow for the partitioning and sharing of code. Initially JavaScript had no support for modules. Node.js, a server side JavaScript application, introduced the concept in order to support complex server side execution of JavaScript. However, with the introduction of ES6 modules have become standard and [browser support](https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import) is almost universal.

Because of the complex history of modules they can be a confusing topic, but it is well worth the time to understand how they work as they will only become more a part of the core web programmer's toolkit.

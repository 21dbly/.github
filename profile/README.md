# Acknowledgements

The instruction makes extensive use of [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) and we highly encourage you to spend many hours getting lost in their exceptional content.

[React](https://reactjs.org) is used to demonstrate the power of web frameworks. Without the significant contributions of the React community we would not be able to stand on the sholders of giants.

Much appreciation goes to [CodePen](codepen.io) for hosting many of the exercises and instruction examples.

The demonstration application `Simon` is based on the game by Milton-Bradley. Simon is a registered trademark of Milton-Bradley. Our use of the name and the game is for non-profit educational use only. No part of the Simon code program should be used outside of that definition.

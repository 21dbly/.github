# Pair Programming

📖 **Required reading**: [MartinFowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)

One of the objectives of this course is to improve your social skills. Working with peers is a great way to do that. You are encouraged to work on your start up application with a classmate as you practice what is known as `pair programming`. Pair programming gained popularity over twenty years ago and is commonly practiced in the industry.

It is important to understand that pair programming is not simply working together, and it is **definitely not** division of labour. It is not a time saving technique. Both parties must be present whenever work is done. Pair programming follows a very specific process where one member of the pair is the driver and the other is the navigator. The Navigator researches and outlines the overall design. The driver handles the keyboard and controls the tactical implementation details. After a reasonable milestone is achieved, or time period (~30 minutes) is exceeded, the driver and navigator switch. It is also important to celebrate milestones together. Cookies work great as motivational rewards.

If done correctly the pair will learn from each other and produce a much better result. If you want to try pair programming (and you are highly encourage to do so) then introduce yourself to others in the class and see if they are interested. You can also use the `pair-programming` channel on Discord to reach out and find a partner.

Once you find a partner read the [MartinFolwer.com article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html) together so that you both have the same understanding and expectations.

⚠ Note: when you turn in an project that you build together as a pair, make sure you include all parties in your application footer. Your GitHub commit history should also represent commits from everyone associated with the creation of the assignment. That means you may need to change who is logged in if you are sharing a computer when you do your commits.

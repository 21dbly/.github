# Editors

The code editor is the workspace of a web application developer. Deeply learning an editor that makes you efficient and flexible will pay significant dividends in your ability to deliver quality work and greatly reduce frustration. A good editor should feel like a friend. If you are constantly arguing with your editor, then perhaps you need a relationship adjustment.

For your work with this instruction I would highly suggest you use two editors. The first one, Visual Studio Code, is your main workhorse for your daily coding activities. The second one, is VI. You will use VI when you are shelled into your production environment and need a simple, but powerful, console based editor for quickly editing text files.

## Visual Studio Code

**Website**: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Created by Microsoft, Visual Studio Code (VSCode), is free and supported by a large community of open source developers. The [2021 Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment) developer survey put VSCode as the number one choice for 71% of professional developers.

VSCode is both simple to use and incredibly flexible and powerful. At its most basic level it represents files in a given directory on the left and an editor space for those files on the right. VSCode then adds excellent git support, auto-formatting, auto-suggestions, build, and debugging support right out of the box for most major programming languages. You can then easily install your choice of thousands of extensions to add whatever functionality you would like. This includes extensions such as an auto-reloading HTTP server to play with your application, an image editor, a spell checker, hex editor, testing frameworks, language servers for debugging and development, linters, or even container management to compartmentalize your development of different projects.

# Node.js

We need to install Node.js in your production environment since that is used to run your services. However, we should just do this as part of the class AMI.

The following console commands install Node Version Manager (NVM).

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash

. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

With NVM installed you can now use it to install different versions of Node.js. We will install the latest long term supported version represented by `lts`.

```sh
nvm install --lts
```

# â˜‘ Assignment
